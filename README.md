## Introduction (this readme is still work in progress)

Extremely barebones but functional frontend for [Funderr dApp](https://github.com/accurec/Funderr) built on [React](https://react.dev/). It uses [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/) to facilitate the integration between the web3 wallet/browser and the dApp. 

NOTE: the frontend is not yet ready for production use and its main purpose is to just expose all available functions of the dApp to the user. The main reason for it to be in this state for now is that the purpose of this project for me was to learn React and ethers.js, and not make the website pretty and user friendly.

## TODO

1) Upgrade the website to be more user friendly and usable.
2) Add "loading/error" states to all components.
3) Add image upload functionality so that we can then pass image URLs to create campaign smart contract call.
