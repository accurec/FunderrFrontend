## Introduction (this readme is still work in progress)

Extremely barebones but functional frontend for [Funderr dApp](https://github.com/accurec/Funderr) built on [React](https://react.dev/). It uses [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/) to facilitate the integration between the web3 wallet/browser and the dApp.
