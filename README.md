## Introduction (this readme is still work in progress)

Extremely barebones but functional frontend for [Funderr dApp](https://github.com/accurec/Funderr). It uses [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/) to facilitate the integration between the web3 wallet/browser and the dApp. 

# TODO

1) Migrate to React.
